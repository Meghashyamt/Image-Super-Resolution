RRDN Network architecture
The main parameters of the architecture structure are:

T - number of Residual in Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB)
D - number of Residual Dense Blocks (RDB) insider each RRDB
C - number of convolutional layers stacked inside a RDB
G - number of feature maps of each convolutional layers inside the RDBs
G0 - number of feature maps for convolutions outside of RDBs and of each RBD output
